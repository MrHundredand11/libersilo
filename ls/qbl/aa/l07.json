On one side there is a flat expanse of moorland, and on the other a landscape of rolling hills that gradually rises toward a range of mountains. At the foot of the tallest hill you can just make out a castle of golden store with turrets from which flutter a host of brightly colored banners.\n\tAhead of you there walks a figure that looks familiar. It is dressed as you are, dressed in a woolen robe with a leather belt and leather sandals. Yours is in a soft green, the figure ahead of you is white. For a while you walk in silence, then as you turn to look at the scenery you find there is a third figure walking behind you. It, too, seems familiar and is dressed in a similar fashion but in a dark brown color.\n\tYou stop and wait for the third figure to catch up to you, but although it keeps walking toward you, it gets no nearer. You begin walking again but keep turning back to look. Finally you bump into something. It is the one who has been walking in front of you. With a sense of shock you realize why you thought these figures were familiar. They are you.\n\tBrown Robe comes up and together you go and sit by the side of the road and talk. White Robe tells you that he/she is your higher self and, far from being distant, is always close to you. Brown Robe laughs and says that he/she is your lower self and also is closer than you think. White Robe opens a satchel he/she has been carrying and sets out bread, cheese, fruit, honey cakes, and wine. You all eat and drink together and, finally replete, you lie back on the sweet-smelling grass and just talk.\n\tYou ask Brown Robe, the lower self, to tell you why it is important to have a lower self. It tells you not to confuse the word lower with less. The work done by the lower self is just as important as that done by the higher self. Part of that work shows you how to enjoy the simple things – food, wine, the laughter of children and companionship of friends, the perfume of a summer night and the cool feel of snow on your face in winter. Brown Robe speaks of the simple love of your pets and the casual affection of your fellow workers, then goes on to speak in reverent tones of the love between you and your partner, of the way in which desire rises and grows into a demand for the sharing of love between you, the touch of hand on hand, and mouth on mouth, the feel of the loved one’s body against yours and the moment of union; the pleasure that goes on and on and then bursts into a flame that carries both of you into the realm of White Robe, the realm of the spirit.\n\tYou listen and realize that making love is as much a prayer as when you place your hands together in church, that you can praise the Creator by creating love between you and your “twin”.\n\tWhite Robe agrees and speaks of the spiritual joy that such love creates on the high levels. “Such a moment becomes for that space of time a radiance that lights up Creation. It is a moment in heaven when the choir sings not just for the One, but for Life. It is a moment in heaven when the choir sings not just for the One, but for Life. It is a moment when you, Green Robe, are closest to God. The higher self watches, waits, and gives help, but only when and if asked. I am untouched by what you do, I remain pure, so that on the day you recognize that I am always within you, the melding will bring nothing but joy.”\n\tBrown Robe takes from his/her pocket a flute and, putting it to his/her lips, begins to play. The tune is sweet and silvery and brings many memories to mind. You lie back on the sun-warmed grass and let the music wash over you. White Robe begins to sing:\n\tWhere did I meet you first, my love?\n\tWhere did we first meet?\n\tWas it in Babylon, my love?\n\tWhen I first sat at your feet?\n\tOr was it on the winding Nile\n\tAs the royal barge went past\n\tThat I first heard your voice, my love?\n\tFor the first time and the last?\n\tI found you on the Delphic chair"

The spine is a road of sensation, learning, experience, understanding, and finally wisdom, leading to the adytum of the brain where it manifests as the burst of power we know as the rising of the Kundalini. It has been said by those who have experienced it that this rising can be both pleasurable and painful. Without pain we cannot recognize pleasure."
