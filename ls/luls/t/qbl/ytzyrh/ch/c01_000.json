He created His Universe by the three forms of expression: Numbers, Letters, and Words.\n\n<span class='font_georgia'>\t<b>2.</b></span>&nbsp;Ten ineffable Sephiroth and twenty-two basal letters: three mothers, seven double, and twelve simple (letters).\n\n\t<b>3.</b>&nbsp;Ten ineffable Sephiroth, corresponding to the ten fingers, five (over) against five and the only token of the covenant in the middle: the word of the tongue and (the circumcision) of the flesh.\n\n\t<b>4.</b>&nbsp;Ten ineffable Sephiroth, ten and not nine, ten and not eleven: understand with wisdom and apprehend with care; examine by means of them and search them out; know, count, and write. Put forth the subject in its light and place the Formator on His throne. He is the only Creator and the only Formator, and no one exists but He: His attributes are ten and have no limits.\n\n\t<b>5.</b>&nbsp;The ineffable Sephiroth: their totality is ten; they are, however, without limits: the infinity of the Beginning and the infinity of the End, the infinity of the Good and the infinity of the Evil, the infinity of the Height and the infinity of the Depth, the infinity of the East and the infinity of the West, the infinity of (the) North and the infinity of (the) South;&nbsp;<i>and only one Lord God, the trusty King, rules them all from His holy dwelling in all eternity</i>.\n\n\t<b>6.</b>&nbsp; Ten ineffable Sephiroth: their appearance is like that of a flash of lightning, their goal is infinite. His word is in them when they emanate and when they return; at His bidding do they haste like a whirlwind; and before His throne do they prostrate (themselves).\n\n\t<b>7.</b>&nbsp;Ten ineffable Sephiroth: their end is in their beginning and likewise their beginning in their end, as the flame is bound to the burning coal.&nbsp;<i>Know, count, and write.</i>&nbsp;The Lord is one and the Formator is one and hath no second (beside Him): what number canst thou count before one?\n\n<span class='font_georgia'><b>8.</b></span>&nbsp;Ten ineffable Sephiroth: close thy mouth lest it speak and thy heart lest it think; and if thy mouth openeth for utterance and thy heart turneth toward thought, bring them back (to thy control).
